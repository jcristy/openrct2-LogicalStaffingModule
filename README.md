# StaffManager

StaffManager helps with the tedious process of hiring and naming your staff.

## Description

Too much clicking. I just want a lot of janitors, and I want them to have names.

## How To

### Install

Place the staffmanager.js file into the plugins folder.
* For Windows (untested) `C:Users\{User}\Documents\OpenRCT2\plugin`
* For Ubuntu and likely other Linux distributions `~/.config/OpenRCT2/plugin`

### Configure Names

Currently, there is not an in-game way to adjust the list of pre-defined names. However, you can modify the OpenRCT2 user config to
adjust the list of names. In Ubuntu, this file, I think, by default is in `$HOME/.config/OpenRCT2/plugin.store.json`. You can carefully
edit this file to add or modify the list of names it picks from.

## Roadmap & Known Bugs

### Roadmap
* Automatically configure janitor zones
